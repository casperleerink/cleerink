title: How End-to-End Type Safety Helped Us Ship Custom MVPs Fast

When you're building MVPs for clients, you usually have to choose between speed and polish. You can move fast with no types, or build slowly but safely. But over the past few years at Hooman Studio, we found a third path — by leaning fully into **end-to-end type safety**, we were able to ship custom-designed, production-ready apps quickly, without sacrificing reliability.

This post outlines how our stack — centered around **Drizzle, tRPC, and Next.js** — helped us deliver tailored software solutions on tight timelines, and what we learned from building multiple MVPs this way.

## The Stack: Minimal, Typed, and Fully Integrated

Our core stack was simple, but powerful:

- **React + meta-framework**: We used frameworks like Next.js and TanStack Start depending on the project, but the principles remained the same: file-based routing, full-stack rendering, and good DX.
- **Drizzle ORM**: SQL schema definition in TypeScript with migration support.
- **tRPC**: Type-safe API contracts between frontend and backend.
- **TailwindCSS**: Rapid UI implementation with full design flexibility.

All of these tools shared one goal: remove boundaries between frontend and backend while keeping everything fully typed and predictable.

Because types flowed through every layer — from the database schema to the client — we could write and refactor features quickly, with full confidence.

## Why Type Safety Matters for MVPs

In fast-paced MVP development, you’re constantly changing things:

- A client wants to add a field to a form? That field needs to be stored, validated, displayed, and editable.
- You need to pivot how a feature works mid-sprint? That change will touch database, server logic, and UI.

Without a strong type system, these changes introduce subtle breakage across layers. But with **end-to-end types**, every refactor is a guided experience — TypeScript simply shows you what needs fixing.

### Example: Adding a New Field

Let’s say we add a `deadline` field to a `Project` model:

- In Drizzle, we update the schema and generate types.
- tRPC exposes the new field automatically in the API.
- The frontend picks it up via autocompletion — no guesswork, no docs needed.

No forgotten fields, no runtime errors, no stale assumptions.

## Going Custom Without Slowing Down

One of the myths about building fast is that you have to rely on off-the-shelf UI kits or prebuilt admin panels. But we wanted to create **custom-designed software** for our clients — tailored UIs, domain-specific logic, and a clean experience.

End-to-end type safety made this possible. Because the stack was tightly integrated:

- We could build and iterate on features fast, without hitting hidden complexity walls.
- There was no impedance mismatch between API and frontend.
- New developers could onboard quickly, thanks to fully typed interfaces and editor tooling.

In many cases, we shipped full MVPs — complete with dashboards, forms, auth, and realtime components — in just a few weeks.

## MVPs That Can Grow Up

One of the biggest benefits of our approach is that even though we moved fast, **we didn’t take on technical debt that would prevent future growth**. Our MVPs weren’t throwaway experiments — they were solid foundations for products that could scale.

Because we used real technologies — like Drizzle, PostgreSQL, tRPC, and modern React frameworks — we could support more users, features, and complexity later on without a total rewrite.

### What Changes as the Product Matures?

Here’s how we adapted our stack as projects moved beyond MVP:

- **More strict API validation**: While early versions relied on inferred tRPC schemas, later stages introduced shared validation using tools like `zod`, and more granular error handling.

- **Modularization**: MVPs often start as monoliths. As complexity grows, we split features into well-defined modules or services — sometimes even separate packages within a monorepo.

- **Data migrations & versioning**: MVPs typically get by with straightforward schema changes. But once you’re live, you need more controlled database migrations, rollback strategies, and change tracking. Drizzle made this easy to introduce incrementally.

- **Background jobs & queues**: In the MVP, you might do everything in a request. Later, async tasks (emails, processing, syncing) move to queues (e.g. using `bullmq`, `resend`, or serverless functions).

- **Role-based auth & permissions**: MVPs often assume a single user type. As teams grow and products evolve, we layered in role-based access, multi-tenant architectures, and fine-grained API guards — again, with full type safety.

What’s key is that **none of these evolutions required a tech stack change**. We started with a sane baseline, and expanded as the product demanded — without breaking things or slowing down.

## Lessons Learned

- **Type-first schemas pay off**: By defining database and API types in TypeScript, we reduced bugs and duplicated logic.
- **tRPC is a force multiplier**: Eliminating manual API contracts saved us enormous time, especially in small teams.
- **Frameworks are interchangeable — type safety isn't**: Whether we used Next.js or TanStack Start, our stack remained consistent because type safety was enforced at the boundaries.

## Final Thoughts

MVPs don’t have to be messy. With a tight, type-safe stack, we were able to move fast without sacrificing long-term maintainability — even with custom UIs and complex requirements.

If you’re building apps for clients or internal tools, and want to stay agile without breaking things, I highly recommend trying out this approach. You don’t need a huge team — just the right tools and a commitment to consistency.
